# Fake-News-Classifier
Implemented the fake news classifier using Django as a server-side framework and Html,  CSS, Bootstrap as a frontend technology. The Deep Learning model included an Embedding  layer and Long Short-Term Memory layers which provide complete sentiment of the  sentence. The system accepts text news as an input and predicts the probability of news being  True or fake.
